# JW_SC_AI: A StarCraft II AI Project

## Part 1

Utilizes the SC2 python library to make a generic build order and attack strategy that's defined by checks on timing, available resources, and army size.

## Part 2

Utilizes Keras and Tesnforlow to first create data for a build order and attack strategy decided at random.  nn_starcraft_tutorial.py is a neural network model (specifically a convolutional neural network built using sequential layers) that learns off of the data generated by dl_starcraft_tutorial.py which is randomly decided.  dl_stracraft_tutorial.py can be changed to either make decisions randomly or off of the model generated by the neural network.

## Part 3

Same concept as Part 2, but more numerous decisions (every building and unit is now a separate function) and advanced scouting and army tactics.
