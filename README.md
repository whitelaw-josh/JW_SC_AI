# JW_SC_AI: A StarCraft II AI Project

## Part 1

Utilizes the SC2 python library to make a generic build order and attack strategy that's defined by checks on timing, available resources, and army size.

## Part 2

Utilizes Keras and Tensorflow to first create data for a build order and attack strategy decided at random.  nn_starcraft_tutorial.py is a neural network model (specifically a convolutional neural network built using sequential layers) that learns off of the data generated by dl_starcraft_tutorial.py which is randomly decided.  dl_stracraft_tutorial.py can be changed to either make decisions randomly or off of the model generated by the neural network.

## Part 3

Same concept as Part 2, but more numerous decisions (every building and unit is now a separate function) and advanced scouting and army tactics.  Issues at this point are caused from multiple random decisions causing the bot to not necessarily win against an easy bot.  The future steps of this would to train a model off of wins against an easy bot, then use the model to try and beat a medium bot to train a new model, and then use that model to try and beat a hard bot to train a new model at that tier.  Difficulty on these steps occurs due to the bot not necessarily beating the easy often enough to generate training data.
